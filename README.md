# Password Generator

## Description

This password generator is designed to help you create strong, secure passwords that meet your
specific criteria. When you click the password generation button, you will be guided through a
series of prompts to customize your password. You can select the desired length, character types
(lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters), and more. Once you've completed the
prompts, a password that matches your criteria will be generated for you. This password can be
displayed in an alert or written to the page, ensuring that you have a secure and reliable
password at your disposal.
