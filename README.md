# Password Generator

## Description

This password generator is designed to help you create strong, secure passwords that meet your
specific criteria. When you click the password generation button, you will be guided through a
series of prompts to customize your password. You can select the desired length, character types
(lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters), and more. Once you've completed the
prompts, a password that matches your criteria will be generated for you. This password can be
displayed in an alert or written to the page, ensuring that you have a secure and reliable
password at your disposal.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
